Occasionally I will find documents which ought to be on the web but aren't. The below are hosted below for academic purposes as fair use. The following is a running list of papers I host that are perhaps interesting to others.
* Tobler W.R. "[Of Maps and Matrices](/documents/toblermapsmatrices.pdf)", *Journal of Regional Science*, 7 (supplement), 1967, pp. 275â€“280. Wiley, the publisher, maintains electronic copies of the journal but their volume 7 contains [no supplement](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/14679787/year/1967). They've been informed of the error (see case number 11069719) but after two years seem uninterested in fixing it. I have not hosted all the articles online, just this one which I discovered while researching the history of pattern recognition. If you want to see a very early (perhaps the first) demonstration of automated contour mapping, look no further. 
* An unpublished paper by William Kahan and K-C Ng written in 1986, titled simply [SQRT](/documents/softsqrt.pdf). The paper was distributed to a network of colleauges, and, strangely enough, a version of it is preserved in a widely distributed numerical library, [fdlibm](https://netlib.org/fdlibm/). In the **only** discoursive comment block in the whole library, nearly all of the paper is in machine readable text at [e_sqrt.c](https://netlib.org/fdlibm/e_sqrt.c). This scan was graciously provided by David Hough.
