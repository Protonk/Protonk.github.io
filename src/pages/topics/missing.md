Occasionally I will find documents which ought to be on the web but aren't. The following is a running list of papers, hosted for academic purposes as fair use, that are perhaps interesting to others.
* Tobler W.R. "[Of Maps and Matrices](/documents/toblermapsmatrices.pdf)", *Journal of Regional Science*, 7 (supplement), 1967, pp. 275–280. Wiley, the publisher, maintains electronic copies of the journal but their volume 7 contains [no supplement](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/14679787/year/1967). They've been informed of the error (see case number 11069719) but after two years seem uninterested in fixing it. I have not hosted all the articles online, just this one which I discovered while researching the history of pattern recognition. If you want to see a very early (perhaps the first) demonstration of automated contour mapping, look no further.
* An unpublished paper by William Kahan and K-C Ng written in 1986, titled simply [SQRT](/documents/softsqrt.pdf). The paper was distributed to a network of colleagues, and, strangely enough, a version of it is preserved in a widely distributed numerical library, [fdlibm](https://netlib.org/fdlibm/). In the **only** discoursive comment block in the whole library, nearly all of the paper is in machine readable text at [e_sqrt.c](https://netlib.org/fdlibm/e_sqrt.c). This scan was graciously provided by David Hough.
* A post to the Linux Kernel Mailing list by Linus Torvalds in 1995, formerly at [Indiana University's archive](https://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/alpha/9512.2/0027.html) \(link will 404\) regarding an adaptation of the Kahan and Ng's proposed 'recriproot' for glibc on the DEC Alpha architecture. The post is preserved [here](/documents/december-1995-lkml-sqrt.pdf).
