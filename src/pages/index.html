  I'm Adam Hyland, a PhD student working in 
  <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/csclab/">Charlotte Lee's lab</a> 
  in the Human Centered Design and Engineering department at 
  the University of Washington. My research 
  interest is in how communities of practice (often but not always 
  engineering communities) coordinate around standards, standards 
  processes, and things which look a bit like standards but aren\â€™t.
</p>
<p>
  I care a lot about making the invisible parts of systems all around 
  us easier to understand. Not just so people can become informed 
  (which is cool) but also so people are equipped to play, break, 
  and transform those systems (which is way cooler).
</p>
<p>
  I teach Information Visualization, a complex and tool-laden topic 
  like so much in Human-Computer Interaction. My approach, 
  which I feel helps students remain curious in a space like this, 
  is to show students that struggling with tools (many of which represent 
  thousands and thousands of person-hours of work) is <strong>not their 
  fault</strong>. Really excellent visualization and in many ways, the 
  kinds of personal growth we sometimes call 'learning', can only
  occur if we productively struggle together.
