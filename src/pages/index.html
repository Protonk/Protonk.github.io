  I'm Adam Hyland, a PhD student working in 
  <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/csclab/">Charlotte Lee's lab</a> 
  in the department of Human Centered Design and Engineering at 
  the University of Washington. I am interested in how communities of practice 
  (often but not always engineering communities) coordinate around standards, 
  standards processes, and things which look a bit like standards but aren\â€™t. 
  I care a lot about making the invisible parts of systems all around 
  us easier to understand. Not just so we become better informed 
  (which is cool) but so we are equipped to play, break, 
  and transform those systems (which is way cooler).

  <i>Areas of work:</i>
  <p>
  Computer Arithmetic: My interest in computer arithmetic is in demonstrating and teaching 
  the dramatic impact and importance of this invisible, negotiated, coordinated part of our world. 
  Arithmetic on computers has moved from a central part of programmer training to being supplied 
  by a vast array of libraries and standardized interfaces. Showing how this embedding works and 
  has changed us as users, programmers, and designers is my goal.

    <li>The "Fast" Inverse \(Reciprocal\) Square Root: In 2009 I wrote a 
    Wikipedia article about a famously terse bit of code to help people 
    understand it. Now I maintain <a href="https://0x5f37642f.com">0x5f37642f.com</a>, 
    which helps people understand how the spread and use of a strange access to
    the logarithm in floating point arithmetic.</li>
    <li><a href="http://coordinating-arithmetic.com">Coordinating Arithmetic</a>: A Sloan Foundation 
    funded \(Sloan Grant number G-2023-21011\) project to document the history of how we standardized 
    computer arithmetic with IEEE 754 through oral history interviews and archival research.</li>
    <li>I am the co-secretary for the upcoming IEEE 754-2029 working group, which determines standards 
    for binary and decimal floating point arithmetic, excluding those covered under P3109, the machine 
    learning floating point standards group.</li>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    AI Image Generation: I work to help designers and artists understand the promise and limitations of 
    machine image generation, principally through exploring and experimenting with 
    abberant and adversarial image prompts. Doing so is effective in helping people 
    care about and inspect their functioning, which is increasingly 
    critical as more and more of our visual culture is generated by these systems.

      Hands Are Hard: Unlearning How We Talk About Machine Learning in the Arts, listed below, is an attempt 
      to introduce artists to machine image generation by focusing on an area where early generators like 
      Stable Diffusion struggle: human hands. Artists must understand how these systems work; one highly effective 
      way to do so is to understand where they don't.
