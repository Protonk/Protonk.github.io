    This place is web 1.0 levels of under construction. If you feel this page 
    missing something, please let me know. It is likely in my google drive
    awaiting migration here--if it is something **not** in my google drive,
    I would very much like to know about it.

    In 2001 an approximation of a reciprocal square root (y = 1/sqrt(x)) leaked to 
    the internet, was attributed to a charismatic hacker, and attained the kind 
    of fame normally reserved for soap opera stars or particularly photogenic zoo 
    animals. This fame allows us to, quite incidentally, follow the normally 
    invisible history of a mathematical approximation over time, across many 
    organizations, and through co-creation of formal knowledge.
  </p>
  <p> 
    Working with oral history interviews, archival material, and source code, 
    this project is an attempt to follow this trace which, far from being born 
    from the brow of a 90s programmer, spans most of the history of the digital 
    computer.

  <h2>Hang on, isn't the magic constant "0x5F3759DF"?</h2>

  <p> 
    That's right! This page is named 0x5f37642f, Lomont's optimal constant for the 
    approximation derived <strong>without</strong> the next step of Newton-Raphson 
    (NR) in mind. Considering the next step of NR, Lomont's constant is outperformed 
    by 0x5F3759DF, which is the one that leaked to the internet.

  <p>
    This <a href="https://github.com/hyland-uw/FISR-historical">repository</a> contains 
    code to reproduce versions of the FISR. Also contains data and R code to plot
    data.

  <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">Fast inverse square root</a>. 
      It is not up to date completely with all post-2010 changes in understanding. 
      A source and place to find sources. (I wrote the first version but do not 
      maintain it.)</li>

  <h3>Jean-Michel Muller's excellent survey</h3>
  
  <ul>

  </ul>
  
  <h2>Integer operations as logarithmic number system (broadly)</h2>
  <p>
    Works about connections between memory and bit operations on floating-point numbers 
    and logarithmic number systems. Muller also relates the FISR to Mitchell's method.
