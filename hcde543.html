<title>Reflections on design ethics from a crank</title>
A reflection which can be titled:

<p>“Why last week you all had to read a <a href="/ethicalmouse.png">strange zine article</a> attacking a perfectly normal Nordic study for ethical lapses it did not make”</p>

<p>Eighteen and a half years ago, on my birthday no less, the United States government gave an ultimatum to the government of Iraq which 48 hours later would culminate in an invasion. At the time I was stationed on a submarine in the middle of the Red Sea, trained to operate the nuclear reactor onboard. Within days, we would launch more than thirty cruise missiles at targets inside Iraq. What happens on most submarine deployments is a carefully guarded secret, but the Navy was happy to tell <a href="http://archives.starbulletin.com/2003/03/26/news/story2.html">anyone</a> who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120910112000/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2003/Apr/01/ln/ln05a.html">would</a> listen about how its submarines carried out Tomahawk missile strikes. Publicly they were less forthcoming about the exact target list, though snippets were gleefully shared with us by our commanding officer—including one which sticks in my mind to this day, an Iraqi Republican Guard barracks. Writing this today I cannot tell you with certainty when we fired those missiles or when they reached their targets hundreds of miles away, but I cannot escape the likelihood that what we were meant to do was kill the men in those barracks in their sleep. I am responsible for their murder and the deaths of anyone else on our target list, a responsibility in no way attenuated by the fact that I didn’t pull a trigger, plot a course, or give an order. I had a choice and I made it.</p>

<p>I reported onboard a warship; it is perhaps not surprising I went to war. What surprised me came many years later, out of a project I started with Os Keyes on Azriel Rosenfeld and the history of computer vision. We began the project to explore a wonderful little oddity—for 30 years Rosenfeld wrote comprehensive literature surveys of what would come to be known as computer vision, a treasure trove of computing history left under-explored and poorly digitized. In a not inconsiderable way, this is the project which brought me to UW. It may not end up being my thesis work, but thinking about how I could make it into a real project with real contributions to a community of scholars gave me hope that I could undertake the journey of a PhD. In order to make sense of his literature reviews we combed through much of his early research, including work on behalf of the department of defense for automated scene recognition of terrain—work which would undergird the early versions of Tomahawk missile guidance. As far as I can tell, Rosenfeld never directly worked on weapons systems, though the grant officers at the department of defense who signed his checks were presumably not interested in knowledge for the sake of it. His first grant as a PhD student came from the Office of Naval Research and they, the Air Force, or DARPA would principally fund him until his retirement.</p>

<p>Rosenfeld had a choice too, but I think we’re here in this program because we recognize his choice was if not harder than mine, more inchoate. Everyone in this cohort is smart and kind and empathetic, alive to the harm we can cause and the good we can do building, <b>designing</b> the unknowable future. We can’t know for sure if our work on a UX problem or a pure science question will be used later on to harm and we shouldn’t be expected to forecast all possible uses and ascetically refrain from any which might be tainted. I’m not asking that. I’m asking us to instead normalize talking about the ethics of design work <i>especially when it doesn’t appear unethical</i>. It’s not unethical to investigate the distribution of labor between a robot and a human in the home, yet there are ethics to it. We are continuously making choices which will articulate the future. We CANNOT know ex ante if they’re the wrong ones, but we can’t make the right ones without knowing we had a choice in the first place.</p>
